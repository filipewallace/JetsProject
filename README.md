# JetsProject


### Description
This project we were to create an airfield and populate it with different types of jets. The jet's information was read from a different file unless the user decides to add or remove planes. The user gets to choose from a menu on if they want to see the list of the fleet of jets, fly the jets, view the fastest jet, view the jet with the longest range, load cargo jets, dogfight, add a jet to the fleet, remove a jet from the fleet, or quit the program. The program keeps running unless the user decides to quit.
